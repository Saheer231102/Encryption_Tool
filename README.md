This Tool Contain These Following Algorithms
1. Ceaser cipher:
    The Caesar cipher is a basic substitution cipher that shifts letters in the alphabet. While historically significant, it's not very secure due to its simplicity and small key space. Encryption & Decyrption.

2. DES:
    DES is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks. It's a historic algorithm that was widely used but is now considered insecure due to its relatively short key length (56 bits). Encryption & Decryption.

3. AES:
    AES is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits. It's considered a very secure and widely used algorithm. Encryption & Decryption

4. RSA:
    RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission. Encryption & Decryption
   
6. SHA256:
    The Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from any length of input data. One way shing

7. Base64:
    Encoding & Decoding
